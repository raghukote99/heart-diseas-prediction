## 🎓 Sample Doctor Data

The system auto-populates with several sample doctors for demo/testing purposes. The displayed names
are examples only. To find the current doctor's IDs in your running instance, query the doctors
listing and use the returned IDs to access specific profiles:

- List doctors: `GET /doctors`
- Doctor detail: `GET /doctor/<id>` (replace `<id>` with the ID returned by `/doctors`)

Example sample names you may see in the demo database include:

1. Dr. Rajesh Kumar — Cardiologist (example)
2. Dr. Priya Sharma — General Physician (example)
3. Dr. Amit Patel — Cardiologist (example)
4. Dr. Sneha Desai — Nutritionist (example)
5. Dr. Vikram Singh — General Physician (example)

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Flask Settings
```python
app.secret_key = "change_this_to_a_random_secret_key"  # ⚠️ Change in production
app.run(debug=True)  # Set to False in production
```

### Model File
- Location: `heart-disease-prediction-knn-model.pkl`
- Type: Pickled scikit-learn KNN classifier
- Generated by: `train_model.py`

### Database
- Location: `heart_predictions.db`
- Type: SQLite3
- Auto-created on first run

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Model file not found"
**Solution**: Ensure `heart-disease-prediction-knn-model.pkl` exists in project root

### Issue: "Database locked"
**Solution**: Close all connections and delete `heart_predictions.db`, it will regenerate

### Issue: Port 5000 already in use
**Solution**: Change port in app.py:
```python
app.run(debug=True, port=5001)
```

### Issue: Appointments not saving
**Solution**: Check database permissions in project folder
