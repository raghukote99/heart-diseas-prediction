SELECT a.id, a.appointment_date, a.appointment_time, a.status, 
       a.notes, a.created_at, u.username, a.user_id
FROM appointments a
JOIN users u ON a.user_id = u.id
WHERE a.doctor_id = ?
ORDER BY a.appointment_date DESC, a.appointment_time DESC;

-- Get all appointments
SELECT a.id, d.id as doctor_id, d.name, d.specialization,
       u.username as patient_name, a.appointment_date, a.appointment_time, 
       a.status, a.created_at, d.consultation_fee
FROM appointments a
JOIN doctors d ON a.doctor_id = d.id
JOIN users u ON a.user_id = u.id
ORDER BY a.appointment_date DESC, a.appointment_time DESC;
```
